# Introduction

Hypergres turns any Postgres database into a hypermedia API.

## How it Works

Given a Postgres database, PostgREST will generate a REST API on top of it based on the tables, views, procedures, etc. stored in the database.
URLs for running select, insert, update, delete statements and invoking stored procedures are automatically generated.
Normally, the results of these queries are returned as JSON. For example, hitting this endpoint:

```
GET /films?select=title,directors(id,last_name) HTTP/1.1
```

returns:

```javascript
[
  { "title": "Workers Leaving The Lumière Factory In Lyon",
    "directors": {
      "id": 2,
      "last_name": "Lumière"
    }
  },
  { "title": "The Dickson Experimental Sound Film",
    "directors": {
      "id": 1,
      "last_name": "Dickson"
    }
  },
  { "title": "The Haunted Castle",
    "directors": {
      "id": 3,
      "last_name": "Méliès"
    }
  }
]
```

Hypergres allows you to return query result as HTML instead by setting the `Accept` header to `text/html;template=<template_name>`.
This tells Hypergres to take the JSON result of the query and pass it to the template with the specified name.
For example, let's say we had a template named `filmListView` that looked like this:

```html
<ul>
    <li>
    {{
        let render =
                \film ->
                    '''
                    <li>
                        <h1>Title - {{ film.title }}</h1>
                        <p>Directed by - {{ film.directors.last_name }}</p>
                    </li>
                    '''
        in for . render
    }}
    </li>
</ul>
```

Templates are pure functions from JSON to HTML. The result of the template is returned to the client.

This is really useful when used with [htmx](); an extension of HTML that allows ...

Thanks to htmx, we can extend the above example to link to details about the director and have the results of the endpoint swapped into the DOM.

```html
<ul>
    <li>
    {{
        let render =
                \film ->
                    '''
                    <li>
                        <h1>Title - {{ film.title }}</h1>
                        <p>
                            Directed by -
                                <a hx-get="/directors?select=first_name,last_name&id=eq.{{ film.directors.id }}"
                                   hx-headers="{ 'Accept': 'text/html;template=directorDetail'}"
                                >
                                    {{ film.directors.last_name }}
                                </a>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    '''
        in for . render
    }}
    </li>
</ul>
```

Each last name in the list of directors is now a hyperlink to more information about that director.

To learn how Hypergres works first read the PostgREST documentation.
Hypergres does everything PostgREST does plus some other features that make it useful as a hypermedia API.
These include:

- The ability to request HTML instead of JSON
- A templating language to transform SQL query results into HTML
- Editors for creating HTML templates and SQL queries
- A basic file system for images, scripts, CSS, etc.

## Hypergres Templating Language

JSON is turned into HTML using the Hypergres Templating Language. It is basically a purely functional version of the Go templating language.
All templates take a single god object `.` as an argument.
The `.` value contains the results of the SQL query after it has been transformed into JSON by PostgREST, and the request's headers.
The type of `.` is unknown and depends on the result of the query.
We only know that `.` will have a `headers` field representing the request's headers. It may be empty.

All expressions are enclosed in `{{<expression>}}` braces.

```html
<p>Name: {{ .first_name <> " " <> .last_name }}</p>
<p>Salary: {{ .salary }}</p>
<p>Tax: {{ .salary * 0.08 }}</p>
```

You have access to all the basic arithmetic operators, string helpers, list utilites, etc.

Here's a conditional:

```html
<p>Name: {{ .first_name <> " " <> .last_name }}</p>
<p>Salary: {{ .salary }}</p>
<p>Tax: {{ .salary * 0.08 }}</p>
{{
    if .salary > 1000000
    then "<h1>You're a millionaire!!</h1>"
    else "<h1>You're not a millionaire.</h1>"
}}
```

Looping can be done with `for`, which is just `map` with the arguments in reverse position:

```html
<ul>
    {{
        for .students (\s -> 
            '''
            <li>
                <h1>Name: {{(firstLetterOf s.first_name) <> ". " <> s.last_name}}</h1>
                <p>Grade: {{s.letter_grade}}</p>
            </li>
            '''
        )
    }}
</ul>
```

Feeding the following JSON data:

```javascript
{
    "students": [
        { "first_name": "Alice"
        , "last_name": "Givens"
        , "letter_grade": "A-"
        },
        { "first_name": "Bob"
        , "last_name": "Stevens"
        , "letter_grade": "B+"
        },
        { "first_name": "Derek"
        , "last_name": "Smith"
        , "letter_grade": "D"
        }
    ]
}
```

into the template defined above generates the following HTML:

```html
<ul>
    <li>
        <h1>Name: A. Givens</h1>
        <p>Grade: A-</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h1>Name: B. Stevens</h1>
        <p>Grade: B+</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h1>Name: D. Smith</h1>
        <p>Grade: D</p>
    </li>
</ul>
```

Templates are stored in the database in the `templates` table and can be queried and modified just like any other table.

## Hypergres Template Editor

To make the authoring of Hypergres templates easier, Hypergres provides an editor that is aware of your
databases' structure and available templates. The editor helps by providing suggestions for URLs when the
developer uses `hx-get`, `hx-post`, etc. attributes. When using `hx-post` for insert queries or invoking stored procedures,
the editor will look for values in the DOM that will be sent with the request and ensure that they match up with the argument type
of the query. There should be a query builder. Hyperscript should be supported.
You should be able to turn complex queries into views so you don't get long URLs that clutter up you HTML.
The editor will also suggest templates that match the type of your queries.
If none are available, the editor will suggest you create a new one.

The Hypergres Template Editor makes creating Hypermedia-Driven apps a smoother experience.

## Internet of Code

You can link to valid HTL code using URLs. URLs are replaced with the expression that they link to and
are typechecked and executed just like any ol' HTL expression. For example; let's say we have the following template
hosted at https://xyz.com/itemView:

```html
<li>
    <p>Item Name: {{.item_name}}</p>
    <p>Price: ${{let markup = 0.1 in dollarFormat (.item_wholesale_price * markup + .item_wholesale_price)}}</p>
</li>
```

You could call the template defined from another template like so:

```html
<ul>
    {{ for .items https://xyz.com/itemView }}
</ul>
```

This will render the item view for each item in items.

You can link to templates in your own database.
Should detect if URL is internal to make optimizations.
